[Prim algorithm](https://wiki.froth.zone/wiki/Prim's_algorithm) is an algorithm that finds the minimum spanning tree for a weighted undirect graph. The algorithm operates by building this tree one vertex at a time, from an arbitrary starting vertex, at each step adding the cheapest possible connection from the tree to another vertex.
